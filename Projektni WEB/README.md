# Project WEB
 This is a website i created for an assignement in High School.  
 I did use a template for the layout of the website, but the point of the assignment was to use SQL to make the website function.  
 An aditional thing I added was saving a shopping cart to a cookie, a JS contdown timer, and an easter egg in the 404 page.
 If you input the konami code while on a 404 page, it would display a pixel art image of Midoriya Izuku from BNHA.
