# Project Digital Technics
 This is the final project I did in Hight School.  
 It's a project where I used an Arduino to control 28 individual Servo motors. The pdf file documents the process.  
 Initially this project included some Arduino Libraries, but I didn't add them to this repository.  
 This is a really easy project, considering I used an Arduino, but I thought it might not be such a bad idea to include it here.  
 Arduio was used because it was required by the class.
