# Serial Program
 Back when I was studying the STM32 our Professor gave us assignments to each make our own program that uses Serial communication over a COM port to communicate with the STM32 microcontroller.  
 Depending on the projects we did, like sending info to the STM to turn on lights or receiving data from the STM we expanded the program.  
 The one I made included multiple menus for each of the requirements. Source code and all is included.
