# Programming Project
 This is a project that we were supposed to do without a database in the first half of the school year (since we didn't learn it yet in class), and than later, at the end of the year, expand it with a DB.  
 I found C# and SQL really interesting at that period, and I did everything in the first half. We never covered SQLite in school.  
 The project isn't anything extraterrestrial. I had no idea what to do for a project, so I decided to make a "Demo" project to showcase certian things we used in school, and then some.  
   
 Below is a translation of the READ.txt file:  
 "Elmin Softic Projektni 32bit" is a self-extracting ZIP File.  
 It contains the program and all files required for it to work without Visual Studio.  
   
 "Projektni Zadatak Programiranje" contains the code and all files from VS.  
   
 "Project Files" Contains the images used in the program.  
  
 The database is made using SQLite packets. All SQLite files are in the project folder.  
 If no Database is found, you can form it using the included DBManager program that I integrated into a Dev menu. You can access the Dev menu by pressing ~ on your keyboard while in the welcome screen.  
  
 The DB is a basic login info DB, but it exists purely for demonstration purposes.
